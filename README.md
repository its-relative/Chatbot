# Creating a Chatbot with Deep Learning, Python, and TensorFlow

Are you fascinated by the world of conversational AI? Look no further! This GitHub repository houses the code and files for building an intelligent chatbot using cutting-edge technologies. ðŸ¤–

## Overview:
- **Objective**: Develop a chatbot capable of natural conversations.
- **Tools**: We leverage the power of **TensorFlow 2.0** to create a robust neural network.
- **Dataset**: We use the **Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus**, containing over 220,000 conversational exchanges between movie characters.
- **Model**: Our chatbot is based on the **Transformer architecture**, which excels at handling variable-sized input using self-attention layers.

## Key Features:
1. **Preprocessing**: We preprocess the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus using **TensorFlow Datasets** and create an efficient input pipeline.
2. **MultiHeadAttention**: We implement this crucial component using **Model subclassing**.
3. **Transformer Magic**: Dive into the world of parallelizable layers, long-range dependencies, and self-attention mechanisms.
